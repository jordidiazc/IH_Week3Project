CROSSFIT ATHLETES 

In this project I have taken a database with information from CrossFit athletes from all over the world and I have analyzed it. The main analysis used data from the USA and Europe and compared them by analyzing fields such as: the difference in weight, their fitness, their strength among other things.
Data you are using (and comments, main challenges, strengths & weaknesses, etcâ€¦)

To clean the data I have used the following formulas: replace, drop and dropna.

CONCLUSIONS: 

The majority of people who do Crossfit are from the USA
In the USA there are more women who practice and more people practice it in Affiliate
IN the USA the average athlete is slightly older and heavier. That probably correlates with them being stronger
On the other hand, in Europe, athletes have shown greater fitness in the tests carried out.
